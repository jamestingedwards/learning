Issues publishing flow

Convertible to MarkDown via GDocs Tools -> Script -> "ConvertToMarkdown" -> get GMail

## Goals

* Quickly create and collaborate on content (without distraction of formatting and presentation)

* Make content visible and findable for team members

* Pain-free bundling of content into output formats:

    * Beautiful print-layout documents

    * Online publication (ideally clean, accessible, open formats)

* Pain-free hand-over to our Comms team & external partners/helpers

## Allegedly agile writing process (published != perfect)

## Tools

### GDocs

Our main document writing and sharing platform. Excellent collaboration features. Not quite so good for producing beautiful final web or print output.

Free to access and readily used by most people with web browsers, except those in conservative corporate environments.

Tools for output:

* ConvertToMarkDown script: works but clunky/hacky -- many clicks, permissions for one export action

* Gabriel: 

### MarkDown

Simple markup format for plain text files, which labels headings, bullets, bold, and other formatting. Easy to convert to final HTML and plug into automated tools.

### Proof.me

Tool for sharing any type of file for feedback (used and recommended by Mohawk Media).

### GitHub Pages

NetHui website platform. Works from MarkDown content to make fast, secure, static websites. Templates can produce basically any desired appearance (including print layouts).

### Drupal

Current website platform. Awkward to work with and get content into.
